I'm Logan Cooper. I'm a data scientist and software engineer currently working as an Analyst at EBP US. I'm interested in how we can apply the techniques of data science and machine learning to the world of economics and public policy. Research-wise that means working on things like how we can [use computer vision to measure corruption](https://github.com/ldtcooper/ussr-obesity) or how NLP can be applied to track public perceptions of crime and policing. I'm also instereated in how those tools can be applied outside of traditional research, which is why I'm also interested in civic tech and policy data science.  Before going back to school, I worked as a software engineer for several years, working on projects from interactive business simulations, to dashboarding and data viz, to building data pipelines for the San Francisco Federal Reserve. 

If that sounds like experience you could use, feel free to check out my repositories or my [portfolio site](https://www.logan-cooper.com/), or get in touch at ldtcoop@gmail.com.
